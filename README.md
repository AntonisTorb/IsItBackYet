# IsItBackYet
Discord bot that checks if a website is down and messages users if it's back up.

## To do

- ~~Add configuration and commands~~
- Add blacklist filter for spammers
- ~~Add initial check when user submits in case website is up.~~
- Add different logic and response for each status code group.
- ~~Add url validation.~~
- Maybe add backup db with tasks in case bot crashes, load on startup if any data in it.
